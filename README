Various jQuery plugins I've created over the years

Support - contains plugins that might go under jQuery.support but for now are just plugins

border radius support - Determines which style properties the element, and therefore the browser, supports for rounding the border of elements. Returns an object containing three boolean properties: moz, webkit, and css3.
